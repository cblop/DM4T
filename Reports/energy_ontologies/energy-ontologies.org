* A Survey of Energy-related Ontologies

** BONZAI Ontology
** OPTIMUS Ontology
** Urban Energy Ontology
*** Pros:
- First link for Google search: "energy ontology"
- Defined in OWL
*** Cons:
- Every single link to the OWL is broken
- Will have to email someone to get the ontology
** SynCity
Appears to be a toolkit for modelling cities rather than an ontology per se.

UES (urban energy systems, Imperial) ontology covers electricity and heat


There's also the similar:
STS (socio-technical-systems, Delft) ontology covers gas, natural gas

** Ontologies for smart homes and energy management: an implementation-driven survey

- ThinkHOME project (reuses the DogOnt ontology)
- BONSAI ontology
- CoBrA describes device features

They end up basing their work on the combo of DogOnt and CoBrA

Provides house modelling and reasoning capabilities to the DOG (Domotic OSGi Gateway)

5 main hierarchy trees:
- building thing: modelling available things
- building environment: modelling where things are located
- state: stable configs that (controllable) things can assume
- functionality: modelling what controllable things can do
- domotic network component: modelling features peculiar of each domotic plant

* EHS Taxonomy
Not as flexible as an ontology
* DomoML
Ontology for representing household environments.

No state modelling.
* SOUPA
Too general, just to do with agents and security
